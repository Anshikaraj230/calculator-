How It Works

The program starts and welcomes the user.
It prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It displays a menu of four operations:

2: Subtraction
3: Multiplication
4: Division
The user enters their choice (1â€“4).
The program checks the choice:

If the choice is invalid, it informs the user.
The program ends after displaying the result or error.
